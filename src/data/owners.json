    "notable_trends": "From 2019 to 2024, private equity and PE-backed media firms have increasingly targeted educational, science, and children’s YouTube channels. High-profile deals—such as Electrify Video Partners’ stake in Veritasium and Moonbug’s acquisition of Cocomelon—reflect a strong push toward long-form, brand-safe content. More recently, PE-backed firms have begun diversifying into niche verticals like automotive, tech, and history, while also supporting Shorts-first creators to capture emerging audience formats.",
    "limitations": "This dataset may omit smaller or unannounced deals, lacks precise YouTube channel IDs/URLs for many entries, and may undercount TikTok-native creators who have not publicly disclosed PE affiliations."
