Bug: Returning incorrect channel

Description: When the user clicks a different channel's video from the video watch v= screen, the app returns the previous channel's video as correct. 

Theory: This is because the url changes immediatley, causing the app to check the page's DOM and find the old video's channel owner before YouTube unloads and loads the next video's channel link. 

Fix: Add a 1000ms wait timer before checking the DOM to give YouTube time to load the next video. 

Notes: I should implement a better solution eventually, in case some edge case happens where the DOM still doesn't unload after a second of waiting.
